Her vision was not restored as a healthy person, but she is back to the mum that I knew back then (She was stressed and anxious last year to the point that I can't recognize her). Med prescription is important, but a patient's psychological status will help to deal with the disease. Dr. Cohen is such a positive, encouraging, and inspiring doctor. The prescription that you receive during his appointment - that no other doctor is giving you - is support, confidence, and hope. I am grateful that he brought me back the mum that I used to have.  * Last thing to mention, Dr. Cohen's staffs are very helpful and patient. One takes on the attributes of one's associates.

He nervously added not to read what people say online and that he was the « best out here ». I then asked what he recommended and he said lasek. Fortunetly for me, the machine used for lasek wasn’t working that day. I calmly and respectfully said I would think about it and left. He was rude, condescending and impatient. I do believe that the people who say they had a good experience with him are not lying, but as for me it’s a strong NO.

So I already trusted him very much. I'm experiencing a tiny bit of dry eyes but nothing crazy - and I think it should go away in a few weeks."", ""L'expérience fut parfaite avec le dr. Bashour. Il a opéré rapidement et avec précision. Pour les gens voulant l'intervention la plus rapide, je le recommande fortement.

Je suis rentré dans la salle d'opération et en moins de 10 minutes, j'étais déja sorti."", 'I wish I could say I had a good experience with Dr.Bashour but I didn’t. I have had to go through a lot since my laser surgery in 2016 and have not been able to speak to or see him once. Since my surgery, I have been struggling with sensitivity to light and extremely dry eyes which I was told would be temporary at first and now it is obvious that this is something I have to live with forever. I have tried literally everything - numerous over the counter eye drops, prescription eye drops with steroids, omega 3’s, nighttime eye gels, warm compresses, and comfort plugs which overall, has not been cheap. When I wake up in the morning it feels like there is sand in my eyes and I cannot do anything until I put eye drops in. Sometimes if I don’t keep up with my eye drops my eyes will get red, itchy and burn. Other times they are just really sore and tired and I get headaches. Yes Dr.Bashour has given me 20/20 vision, however, the quality of my eyes has decreased dramatically.

He was late on the day of my surgery but to no fault of his own as his flight from Montreal was delayed. I also explained my anxiety issues during my pre-op consultation and he was reassuring. Also after the surgery he was friendly and actually remembered I was fretting about anxiety before by commenting how relaxed I was and showed no fear at all.', 'Dear Dr. Bashour,\n\nI am sure that you don’t remember me since you must be doing a lot of Lasik surgeries across Canada. You performed my Advanced Custom Wave front Lasik surgery 3 weeks ago on April 23rd in Mississauga. I had a tough time keeping my eyes as wide open as I could but eventually gave it in. It was a life changing experience for me and I remember giving you a hug after the procedure was done. I honestly wanted to write you a letter and give it to you in person, but I ended up searching your name and found you here instead. I just wanted to say thank you so much for giving me my life back, just the way I have always wanted it to be. It’s a big deal to me because I have been wearing glasses since grade 3. It didn’t feel too good and contact lenses were not an option for me. Now I can see 20/20 and read posters/bill boards that are far, far away from me. Thanks to you, I also gained some confidence back. It feels amazing to go out without caring about glasses. Glasses were always an inconvenience for me and now I can do anything and pretty much everything without them! I have always dreamt about getting my lasik done and I felt like it was too good to be true for me. There was a lot of financial troubles and the list goes on and on, and this is why I almost gave up. I wanted to get it done back in 2015, 2016 and 2017, and I gave it my best shot, but there was always something stopping me from getting to the next step. I would classify this as a “want” back in the day, but as I grew older and went off to university, this was becoming a “need” on a daily basis. I always felt like glasses stopped me from living my life and it came to the point where the frame started leaving red marks on my face. At this point, it was too much. You basically gave me my life back and thanks to you, I can live my life freely, just the way I have always wanted it. Its amazing because now I can spot the tiny particles of dust/dirt on my table, which my friends cannot see at all and these people have never needed glasses or contact lenses in their lives. They claim that my vision is way better than theirs because I am now able to spot the tiny differences which most of them cannot see or have a hard time seeing.\n\nI feel like a “thank you” will never be enough compared to what you have done for me, but its my first step. I really wish that I could say all of this to you in person, but I am not too sure if that will ever happen and that’s exactly why I had to leave you a message here. I just hope you are not uncomfortable with this in any way as all I ever meant to do is to let you know that I really appreciate what you have done for me and that it means a lot. Now all my troubles are gone. I have gained my confidence back and I am actually living happily. It feels great to be happy for real and you deserve the same kind of happiness in your life.\n\nEven though, words will never be able to describe how thankful I am to you, I just want to say one more Thank you. Thanks a Billion for bringing back happiness in my life. I will always appreciate it and I will always remember you. Its impossible to forget you or your name. I was told that I was very lucky because you were my surgeon and I cannot possibly agree more. 😊 ❤\n\nI wish you all the best and all the happiness in this world.\n\nHave a wonderful day!', 'I held off from having surgery due to my anxiety and fear as I get anxious even going to the dentist. Dr. Bashour was so calm and reassuring before and throughout the surgery which made the procedure so easy! The staff in the OR also held my hand and gave me so much encouragement.

The surgery last 10 minutes as I was so nervous my eyes kept blinking and he explained to me sternly what would happen if I did't stop blinking ( which I needed to hear in order to relax my eye). After the surgery was done, he sat me up and placed his arm behind my back and gently pushed me out and led me out of the room. I didn't even have the time to ask any question after the surgery or get my senses back and their was his business card in my hand and the door was now closed behind me with the Dr no longer in sight. There is no room for error or wasted time in his schedule as he is so tightly booked. I did not like that experience as I was nervous.

He sat next to me and explained to me in a soft calmed voice what was going to happen. At the end, he gave me a very gentle hug that was absolutely reassuring.

My eyesight is incredible, I swear I have like HD-vision - X-Ray vision superhero vision. I can see details I was never able to see even when wearing my contact lenses or my glasses.

Mes deux chirurgies ont très bien été sans aucune complication et très peu de douleur ! \n\nMERCI', 'I had surgery recently and I am lucky to report I only have mild dryness of the eyes. I have read the previous reviews and I can see why some would say he is brash. I was informed he sees a higher number of patients than most of the MDs per day. With his experience, he is more than qualified. There was a touch of empathy when he gave me time to sit up after the surgery on the table. But I felt a little impatience on his part. I think when you manage and perform surgery, it can be a lot to juggle. Overall, I would recommend the surgical procedure but I think any of the other competing clinics are as good. This is because what these clinics want is your money, seeing 20-30 patients per day at a cost of $4K per surgery ... well you get the math. CONS: 1) not really a ""clinic"" where you are treated, and more like a ride on a conveyor belt where you are sent to see multiple different people who have roles to help you get through from start to the finish line, 2) costly (TLC, LASIK MD, etc. all cost approximately the same), 3) you feel like all they want is your money and each person will tell you everything they want you to hear to buy into their service. I guess this happens when doctors go commercial..', ""Dr. Bashour is a medical superhero. He is cheerful and comforting from the moment you walk in, and while the lasik procedure can be a little uncomfortable, he talks to you and reassures you the entire time. It definitely made me less scared! He works lighting fast, and the whole thing is over before you know it! My vision was already better the second I sat up, and I honestly can't believe what I can see without glasses now. If you're thinking about getting your vision corrected, ask for Dr. Bashour.

When he was an hour and a half late for an appointment, he blamed his staff (some bogus reason) and FORCED one of them to apologize to me. It was clear his coworkers were scared of him and basically just tried to appease him. (It was also super bizarre. Why not just say, ""Yeah, I\'m so sorry, traffic was crazy today, thanks for your patience""?) I suspect he\'s nice only if you clearly prostrate yourself to his supposed genius, but god help you if you ask any questions he perceives as disrespectful -- and he\'s super touchy, so that\'s a moving target. He was so agitated by my questions (what type of surgery is best for me; how can we reduce operative and post-operative anxiety and discomfort; please explain what you mean by [insert anything]) that he accused me of being aggressive with him, which was weird, because he was the one being aggressive. He was also vague in his answers (to anything), and of course prompts for clarification weren\'t received well. I forced myself to just stay with it, to not take HIM personally (despite him seeming to do so with me: called me ""you people,"" etc.), but then, at the very last minute, after three eye scans (two within the last month and a half) and previous consult with him (nothing ever mentioned before), he was all, ""Oh, and according to your eye scans you\'re not a great candidate for the surgery"") -- this, moments before the surgery. So, either he had just then noticed it (not confidence-inspiring) or he\'d always known but was going to do the surgery anyway (horrifying) or it wasn\'t actually true and he said it only to get rid of me (unconscionable). Either way, I decided to cancel because the thought of him touching my eyeballs was unthinkable. He actually seemed dangerously unstable at that point. And in a field where the patient pays thousands of dollars out of pocket for elective surgery, there are a lot of options, so he and any clinic that endorses his unprofessional behavior are at the bottom of my list. A very strange and unpleasant man.', ""Excellent doctor. I jusd had my operation at lasikmd (montreal), everything went well.

That inspired me to get the clear vision I've always wished I had. i am 19 years old, and wore contacts every day for 7 years that my eyes couldn't tolerate contact lenses anymore I had enough of dealing with the hassle of contact lenses and glasses. I also came from the Ottawa area to have my Lasik performed by Dr bashour. he has the most experience, over 80,000 patients ! No doctor in Ottawa had performed close to as many. On my surgery day I was really nervous, the staff were all very kind and professional.

Being a little afraid of my surgery, Dr. Bashour was extremely kind took time to talk to be before the surgery and told me how quickly it would be over with. I struggled a little during the surgery with my left eye. I felt some pain, because perhaps the anesthetic did not take too well. The instrument used to hold my eye open was forced a little by the Dr. but it was pain endured for 2 days only, and the benefits outweigh it. He is experienced, sure concise and very FAST. Rest assured he does know what he is doing. I had reached -6.00 each eye with astigmatism, and now am 20/15 in both eyes. It took the three months to stabilize. Thank you Dr. Bashour.

He never explained what he was doing throughout the 2 minutes of the surgery, and I came out with bruised eyes.

The aging population are impatient and just how many patients he puts up with is amazing. Try smiling once in awhile and understand that at times we will have to wait but that is the exception not the norm. Both eyes are now done with multi focal lenses and the results are far above any of my expectations. I believe in only dealing with the the best. So if you are considering an eye surgeon choose Dr. Discepola you will not be disappointed. This man is a perfectionist.', ""Yes, very good doctor. He operated both of my eyes with fill success.. The negative point is the awful lach of punctuality ! Appointment at 10, visit with the doctor at 1:00, and it lasted maximum one minute. Fortunately, I have no vision or eye problem. But why couldn't his office better organized so we wouldn't have to wait 3 hours for a one minute visit ? But, yes, the doctor is very good."", ""Dr. Discepola is the best in the business and so are his staff. I am sure there is no other eye surgeon who can compare to this exceptional man. His expertise, knowledge, care and compassion is far superior to any eye surgeon I have ever met. Here is my story. After being misdiagnosed with a detached retina I met Dr. Discepola at the Glen hospital where he was mentoring students and just about to end his shift. He treated the students with the utmost respect and treated me like royalty. He immediately took charge of the situation and reassured me there was no detached retina (it was a cataract). Subsequently, I met with him in his office where I was absolutely terrified extremely concerned and unable to ask a lot of questions. At that point we only discussed the monofocal lens as I wanted to run from the office. Dr. Discepola detected how tense and nervous I was. Dr. Discepola did not pressure me into discussing any other possible options, I found this to be so very professional because he could have suggested a more expensive lens. We scheduled a follow up visit prior to surgery. At this visit I was able to ask more questions and when I asked Dr. Discepola why he had not discussed the other lens options he simply let me know he had detected from my personality just how nervous I had been. At this final meeting before surgery Dr. Discepola and I decided to go with a multifocal lens. The point here is to demonstrate his ability to detect a nervous patient, remain calm, be very effective and extremely efficient in his ability to manage the situation. Dr. Discepola explained the differences between the lens and mentioned that with the multifocal lens I may see halos for a short time after the surgery. Well I am here to say that I have had one eye done and I now have 20/20 vision and not a single halo (only one which is on top of Dr. Discepola's head)! I am not wearing glasses at all. I go for the other eye in November so stay tuned and I will let you know how it goes!"", 'If you are looking for a good eye dr (ophthalmologist) look no further! Not only is Dr Descepola good, he is the BEST!!! His staff both at his office & at the hospital are very informative, professional & friendly! Dr Descepola is a perfectionist. Along with his honesty & knowledge he will inform & assess you into making the best decision possible! I could not have seen anything as I needed cataract surgery done!! I was "" blinded by the light"". Now, both my eyes have been done & I can honestly say ""it\'s a miracle!!"" I can see for miles, every color is a million times brighter and there are no obstacles in the way!! Everything is so much more enhanced!!! Because I could now see, my confidence is at a whole different level!! All is perfect!! Don\'t hesitate to see Dr. Descepola!! You will not be dissapointed!', ""Ld Dr Discepola est un chirurgien hors-pair. Il est très é l'écoute et prend bien le temps. de nous expliquer l'opération et les conséquences. Je le recommande fortement. Le personnel de sa clinique est également très gentil et compréhensif et surtout très compétent. On se sent en confiance."", ""From start to finish the staff in Dr. Discepola's office and at St. Mary's Hospital were efficient, kind and professional. At all times I was given the explanations I required. Dr. Discepola runs a tight ship. He is in charge of his exceptional technicians and hospital staff. We discussed at length my visual issues and his advice was spot on! After two cataract surgeries I now have monovision. I can see distance well and read without glasses. It was a lucky day when I walked into his office. Thank you. S.B."", ""Dr. Discepola is the best. I have 20/20 vision again and it is absolutely amazing. St. Mary's Hospital staff were great as well."", 'Since last Thursday Jimmy Cliff\'s ""I can see clearly now..."" has been my theme song! I actually feel I have lived a miracle. Two hours after my surgery, my eyes still covered with the security shell, I started noticing details around me through the tiny holes in the shell, details I\'d never noticed before. And when time came to remove the shell, such excitement. I was on a discovery trip. I felt like a child in toyland...the vibrant colours, the details in buildings, reading fine print from a distance and all without glasses and one eye still to go... I even feel I have a new TV screen, the picture is so clear!\nDr Discepola in my eyes is a miracle worker - the surgery was quick, smooth and painless. Now, I can\'t wait to get the other eye done. Kudos to you and your team at St. Mary\'s and at your clinic. A. Grace', ""Dr Discepola a opéré mes deux yeux pour des cataractes.

Wasnt taking the time to explain properly what was causing my infection and what would help it go away wasnt even taking the time to hear what i had to say plus they charge 30$ for eye drops he only put in one eye (i guess to justify the fact they ask for $) plus my appointement was at 1:45 i saw him at 2:30 ...', ""Just had my second eye done by Dr Discepola. I cannot say enough good things about Dr Discepola and his staff. Cataract surgery on both eyes is a long process, not the operation itself, but all the appointments take up a long period of time, so it's important for the office and staff to be well-organized and Dr Discepola's operation runs like a well-oiled machine. But ultimately of course it comes down to competence and in this regard Dr Discepola is brilliant. Do not under any circumstances entrust your eyes to anyone else, Dr Discepola is the king of cataract surgery!!"", 'Absolutely the best!! These are your eyes after all.

Hospital staff at St. Mary's fantastic. Recommending to everyone needing an opthalmologist."", 'I saw Dr. Discepola several years ago and was successfully treated for a cornea abscess. I recall back then having to sit in his waiting room for up to two hours which is what I anticipated when visiting him today. As it turns out, I sat in his office for 3 hours and 40 minutes with the total consultation time measuring no more than 25 minutes. When I asked his staff about this inconvenience, I was told that the wait time was always like this. When I asked Dr. Discepola how he could justify such long wait times, he simply offered to find me another ophthalmologist. I assured him I would be capable of finding one on my own. The staff are pleasant, and Dr. Discepola is a good enough doctor. But personally I shall take my business elsewhere.', 'The staff was so very nice and Rosanna was so nice and caring.', 'Good operating room control. Controls flow of patients preparing for surgery.

After being misdiagnosed with a detached retina I met Dr. Discepola at the Glen hospital where he was mentoring students and just about to end his shift. He treated the students with the utmost respect and treated me like royalty. He immediately took charge of the situation and reassured me there was no detached retina (it was a cataract). Subsequently, I met with him in his office where I was absolutely terrified extremely concerned and unable to ask a lot of questions. At that point we only discussed the monofocal lens as I wanted to run from the office. Dr. Discepola detected how tense and nervous I was. Dr. Discepola did not pressure me into discussing any other possible options, I found this to be so very professional because he could have suggested a more expensive lens. We scheduled a follow up visit prior to surgery. At this visit I was able to ask more questions and when I asked Dr. Discepola why he had not discussed the other lens options he simply let me know he had detected from my personality just how nervous I had been. At this final meeting before surgery Dr. Discepola and I decided to go with a multifocal lens. The point here is to demonstrate his ability to detect a nervous patient, remain calm, be very effective and extremely efficient in his ability to manage the situation. Dr. Discepola explained the differences between the lens and mentioned that with the multifocal lens I may see halos for a short time after the surgery. Well I am here to say that I have had one eye done and I now have 20/20 vision and not a single halo (only one which is on top of Dr. Discepola's head)! I am not wearing glasses at all.

As a result, we had a positive outcome and experience.\nSo, thanks again to all for caring and for all of the hard work you do.\n\nBest regards,\nJoyce', 'I would like to take a moment to address what allot of patients seem to think is an unreasonable time to wait to see a doctor. I have lived in several large cities in Canada & the USA. It’s the same everywhere, we all seem to think we are the only people who have an appointment and who’s time is valuable. Have you ever stopped to think why we wait so long? There are probably a few hundred patients for every doctor and I suspect for specialists the ratio is even higher. \n\nWe have a government that does not invest in our health system. Underpaid nurses & doctors put up with our complaints and whining while working in medical facilities that are beyond aged. Just take a look at our hospitals, what used to be a point of pride in Montreal is now a source of shame. We have let our medical system fall into disrepair over the last few decades and you, the patient, are finally starting to feel it. \n\nWhy, as a whole, do we lash out at the receptionists, nurses, doctors aides and even doctors themselves. Are you tired of waiting 6 months for an appointment, waiting hours after your scheduled time to be seen by a health provider? Then go to the source. Doctors, as most medical professionals, work with (if not for) the government. So let’s report all of these late appointments, long waits and insufficient medical care to the bosses. Our government decides how many to hire, how much to pay them and in the end, how long you have to wait. \n\nStop badgering and calling out the people in front of you. Show them some compassion. They work for the same people we all complain about. If you want to make change, complain to the bosses not the staff. It’s the people who control the purse strings that have created this shortage of trained professionals not the doctors. In other words, your representatives in the government.\n\nAlmost 20 years ago I lost 90 percent of my vision – I lived in Toronto at the time and was very lucky to have found a doctor who truly cared about me and my catastrophic vision loss. Dr. Hadassah Goldberg helped me though a time where I truly believed there was no help. When I moved from Toronto to Montreal a few years ago I had no idea just how hard it would be to find a good eye doctor let alone somebody of the caliber of Dr. Goldberg. After several months of searching and attempting to make appointments I was lucky enough to accompany my mother on an appointment to see Dr. Ali Hafez. While at the appointment for my mother’s eyes, Dr. Hafez was very sympathetic to my issues finding a doctor for my own vision issues. He agree to take me on as a patient. It took months for an appointment and 3.5 hours in awaiting room but I finally was able to see one of the best ophthalmologist in the city. Because of Dr. Goldberg & Dr. Hafez, I am living with what I thought was an insurmountable time in my life. \n\nI truly wish I did not have to chase after appointments and wait for hours in a doctor’s office but it isn’t the doctor who is making you wait, it is the system. Let’s fix the source of the problems and stop blaming the people who are trying to make a broken system work. \n\nIn closing, I just want to give my undying gratitude to all those who put up with our impatient, curt & sarcastic behavior when we have to wait. Next time you have to wait, let them know you know it’s not their fault and maybe even crack a smile. You would be amazed how much a little compassion and a smile can make somebody day just a little bit better. \nThank you for taking the time to read my review \nJames Franc', 'An Excellent doctor by the full meaning of the word....honest, modest and compassionate...saved my eye from advanced glaucoma... and brought me back my vision....His waiting list is long but he deserves the wait....I wish all doctors were as responsible as he is....', ""Merci à toute l'équipe!!

I visited the Eye Clinic for measurements prior to surgery on both eyes. Surgery was performed at the eye clinic on Marcel-Laurin. After delays in the waiting area I was moved to the inner clinic for preparation. The eye surgery took about 1/2 hour after which I was able to return home. No more glasses, no more cataracts.

I booked an appointment with him because he was rated as a great pediatric ophthalmologist. We actually went to him for a second opinion for a minor strabismus. While I completely respect and appreciate his diagnosis, the visit/appointment was horrible and I quite traumatic for my son. First, we waited 2 hours before being seen. Two hours! For a toddler that is just not right. The secretary even told me that he was on time and would be seen soon. Second, the waiting room was packed and I felt like distancing regulations for COVID were impossible to respect, which made me nervous. Third, the time with the doctor was rushed and he was not very nice. That is not an environment for kids. He hardly listened to me then rather abruptly and forcefully put drops in my son’s eye. I tried to slow him down so I could explain what was happening for my son but it was impossible. My son (who is calm and easy going) left the room crying, as did the 6 kids before and after him. That is just not right. There is a way to approach kids that makes seeing a doctor less traumatic. The examination after the drops was equally as quick and intense with getting my son in ‘position’ for the exam. Needless to say, our appointment was 3 months ago and it still gets me upset thinking about it. We went back to our original Dr for a follow-up. Kids need calm, happy doctors who take at least 30 seconds to interact with them and make them feel comfortable.', 'When I had painful shingles in my eye I was more than happy to be under the care of Dr. Kavalec who diagnosed the condition and treated it while on call one evening around dinner time.

The baby and parents are super happy!', 'Honestly, i know hard to believe a 5 star rating, but that was my experience. Dr Kavalec recently operated on my 93 year old father on both eyes and the experience has been exceptional from start to finish. From the first visit, his patience, explanation and even his effort to speak greek to my father. Then his secretary who was wonderful and efficient in booking my dad and providing us all the details and logistics flawlessly. Despite the covid situation at hospitals, both operations conducted with all safety measures and very efficiently. then the immediate follow ups were also easy, pre planned, and efficient. So all in all, a happy 93 year old dad who can now read his newspapers, books, and computer again perfectly and most times he does so without any reading glasses as well. As you can imagine he was frightened to undergo this procedure at a time like this but was relieved, pleased, and has now new freedom with his eyes again.

Deux semaines après mon tv avec le dr Kavalec, son assistante me téléphone pour me donner un rendez-vous pour une opération aux yeux, soit guérir les cataractes. Donc, je n’avais pas besoin d’opération dispensée dans le secteur public (hôpital St-Mary’s) mais le dr qui œuvre aussi dans le secteur privé était prêt à m’opérer.

Hence the low helpfulness rating I have given him, as I have left that office with a heavy heart, knowing that this disorder is treated with a painful cornea transplant but had no details... I can't comment on his knowledge as no clarifications or assurances were ever given either.

Recently he performed cataract surgery on both eyes which was executed flawlessly through each stage (pre-op, post-op, follow-up, surgery etc...).

Needing cataract surgery, I asked trusted friends, I read ratemds.com reviews, and I asked hospital staff who they would select when it was their turn. Over and over, one name came up, Dr. Chaim Edelstein. About 30 seconds into my first appointment with Dr. Edelstein I knew I had found the person to operate on my eyes. I observed that in every appointment and surgery, Dr. Edelstein is 100% focused and concerned about how he is going to improve the vision of his patient. I believe that other patients sense this as his busy (understatement) office is unusually quiet as patients wait their turn. The feeling of the ""crowd"" is that we are all in ""good hands"". His office staff is friendly, efficient and talented. His surgery team at The Jewish is a dream team. In my first cataract surgery, I was the first of his 24 operations at 6:30 am and for the second I was last at 2:00 pm. The team level of enthusiasm and caring for each patient was just as high at both times. Kudos to that team who patients seldom ""see"" but hear. This was my first hospital surgery and I was very impressed. Dr. Edelstein\'s team creates a very calming atmosphere for the patient because of their proficiency. I got the feeling that Dr. Edelstein\'s team is very proud of the work that they do every day. Simply stated, they change people\'s lives dramatically. I can now see colors like never before. My night vision is dramatically improved and I now have negative awareness of my previous vision limitations. I followed Dr. Edelstein\'s pre-op and post-op directions exactly and the results are, in a word, ""amazing"". I continue to recommend Dr. Edelstein to friends and family (he may have to put some more chairs in the hallway).

Sandra and Michael Dubinsky, your most loyal patients', 'English version follows\n\nJ\'ai été opérée par Dr Edelstein pour une cataracte à l\'oeil gauche, et j\'ai été insatisfaite à tous points de vue. Il s\'est comporté comme si ma vision n\'était pas de mes affaires. \n\nIl m\'a suivie à intervalles réguliers avant de procéder avec l\'opération. À chaque rendez-vous, j\'essayais de poser mes questions de la façon la plus claire et la plus concise possible. Lorsque je demandais à quel résultat je devais m\'attendre, sa seule réponse était : « Attendez-vous à porter des lunettes ». Lorsque j\'insistais pour avoir des détails, il s\'impatientait et haussait le ton.\n\nJ\'ai décidé de lui faire confiance, et je l\'ai regretté. Je n\'entrerai pas dans les détails médicaux car mon cas n\'est pas typique, mais moi qui avais été myope toute ma vie mais avec une excellente vision de proche, je me suis retrouvée très presbyte du jour au lendemain, sans en avoir été prévenue, sans avoir été informée de mes options et sans jamais d\'explications. J\'étais dans la mi-cinquantaine au moment de l\'opération et je devrai vivre avec les conséquences pour le reste de mes jours.\n\nJ\'ai connu de multiples effets secondaires suite à l\'opération, et encore aujourd\'hui je « sens » mon implant. Je ne peux cependant pas affirmer que ces problèmes sont dûs à la performance de Dr. Edelstein.\n\nDe plus, les employés de Dr Edelstein semblaient constamment stressés, et l\'attente était INTERMINABLE, à un point où c\'est irrespectueux pour les patients qui sont en majorité âgés. Trop de patients ont rendez-vous tous en même temps le matin, il n\'y a pas suffisamment de places dans la salle d\'attente et souvent de nombreuses personnes doivent attendre pendant plus d\'une heure debout dans le corridor.\n\nPour conclure : craignant un résultat similaire pour mon autre oeil, j\'ai consulté un autre ophtalmologiste (que j\'ai trouvé sans référence, sans délai et sans difficulté, et aussi couvert par la RAMQ). Ça a été la meilleure décision de ma vie, car cette fois mon expérience a été entièrement positive et heureusement j\'ai pu obtenir une vision très satisfaisante - de près et de loin, et sans lunettes - avec mon oeil droit.\n\nEn résumé, mon conseil à vous qui lisez ceci : si un ophtalmologiste ne répond pas à vos questions, ne vous informe pas de vos options, vous traite comme si votre vision n\'était pas de vos affaires, SAUVEZ-VOUS EN COURANT ! Ne vous faites pas opérer avant d\'être sûr d\'avoir obtenu toutes les informations auxquelles vous avez droit.\n\nEnglish version:\n\nI was operated by Dr. Edelstein for a cataract on my left eye, and I have been dissatisfied on all accounts. He treated me as if my vision was none of my business.\n\nHe followed me at regular intervals before proceeding to the operation. On each appointment, I tried to phrase my questions in the most clear and concise way possible. When I asked what result I should expect, his only answer was ""Expect to wear glasses"". If I insisted for more details, he grew impatient and raised his voice.\n\nI decided to trust him, and I have regretted it. I will not go into medical details as my case is not typical, only that having been short-sighted all my life, but with an excellent near vision, I found myself very far-sighted overnight, without warning, without being informed of my options and without ever an explanation. I was in my mid 50s at the time and will have to live with the consequences for the rest of my life. \n\nI had many side effects after the operation, and to this day I can still ""feel"" my implant. However I cannot go as far as to say that these problems are a result of Dr. Edelstein\'s performance.\n\nFurthermore, Dr. Edelstein\'s employees appeared constanly stressed, and the waiting time was ENDLESS, to a point where it is disrespectful to the patients, a majority of whom are aged. Too many patients are called in at the same time in the morning, and as there are not enough seats in the waiting room, often many people have to wait standing up in the corridor for an hour or more.\n\nIn conclusion: fearing for a similar result for my other eye, I consulted another ophtalmologist (whom I found with no references, delay or difficulty, and also covered by the RAMQ). It has been my best decision ever, this time my experience was totally positive and luckily I obtained an very satisfactory vision - near and far, and without glasses - with my right eye.\n\nTo sum up, my advice to those reading this: if an ophtalmologist does not answer your questions, does not inform you of your options, treats you as if your vision is none of your business, RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! Do not go ahead with the operation before you are assured you have received all the nformation you\'re entitled to.', ""Dr. Edelstein came highly recommended and didn't disappoint.

The secretaries were courteous and set up all my appointments without any fuss. I am relatively young for cataracts and was obviously quite concerned. I was surprised at some of the fees (300 for lens implant) so I did seek other opinions and the fees seem to be standard amongst all eye surgeons (including the 30 fee for drops). I had both eyes done within one month of each other and cannot remember ever seeing as clearly as I do now, and I do not even need glasses. I have heard of other horror stories after cataract surgery, but with Dr. Edelstein you are getting the best. I am completely satisfied and highly recommend him. If you are looking to make a new friend then maybe he is not the eye doctor to see. If you want the best care around, and to have outstanding results from eye surgery, then he is the right choice.

His follow ups are extremely thorough, which reassured me that I made the correct decision to entrust my ocular health to Dr. Edelstein. He answered all my questions in a manner that was easy to understand. The reception room is busy because of his highly regarded reputation.

His knowledge is at least doubtful since after seeing me two times he sent me to a well renown doctor at the Jewish hospital for a diagnostic.

His expertise,undivided attention, and gentle manner easily rate him a 10-plus in my books. For 22 years I needed eyeglasses to read. Since my cataract surgery over 7 years ago, I have not put on a pair of glasses. My long distance vision was becoming increasingly blurred and unfocused. After the surgery (both eyes), my long distance vision was crystal clear and perfectly focused. As the saying goes, I could see ""as far as the eye could see.""

The worse part was after waiting nearly 2 hours, he tells me he doesn't do minor surgeries anymore and referred me to a private clinic... I strongly suggest you look for alternate eye care help. I am now with a doctor that apologies to me if I wait as little as 20 minutes. Wish I would have found this doctor before, would have saved hours in waiting room time.

During the entire procedure he explained what he was doing keeping me at ease. After removing the patch, I was able to see much better and everything was much brighter. The follow up appointment went smoothly and the doctor was elated to the results. Soon thereafter we scheduled the second eye. All went well as the first and now after wearing glasses for most of my life, I only require reading glasses for some very small print. This office is run very efficiently by Dina his receptionist.

Added to that, he operates on lines of patients at surgeries in two hospitals: all at breakneck speed. He is efficient, professional and talented. Does he smile and charm each person who enters? I really don't know or care. I went there to have cataracts removed and now, because of him my eyesight is 20-20.

Another patient when he found out how long people had been waiting went to the dollar store and bought two huge bags of snacks like chips, candy bars, fruit juice and springwater.

One to do visual acuity and eye pressure measurements and the other to do an OCT scan of your macula. After that starts the long wait to see the esteemed surgeon. \n\n As for Dr. Kapusta,he is a very hard working retina surgeon who will take his time to examine each patient carefully until he has seen every one waiting by the end of the day meaning 8 pm or even later. He also is teaching his invaluable skills to residents. He told me himself that he has done thousands of vitrectomies and retina operations. \n\n He reattached my retina by vitrectomy and gas bubble about five years ago and I am super satisfied with the results.

Amazing Doctor !', 'I absolutely agree with the comment below. Dr Kattleman is competent, helpful and experienced.\n\nOn the other hand, I was utterly SHOCKED by the attitude of his receptionist. \nI felt completely insulted even over the phone. When arrived, she completely ignored me and took what seem to be a casual phone call. \nAs I politely greeted her to let her know I had an appointment, she became aggressive and told me to wait until she was finished then turned her back on me letting me wait longer.\nWhen she finally deigned acknowledge my presence, she began throwing her office supplies over her desk as she needed to use it to complete formalities - including a rubber stamp and a pair of scissors. (to demonstrate her irritation, I guess?)\n\nSince it was my very first appointment, I wasn\'t sure wether I should feel legitimate telling the Doctor and I regret it now.\nThat said, I\'m pretty sure she heard me complaining about it over the phone to one of my relatives and after my consultation was done and I gave up reporting her behaviour to Dr Kattleman, I overheard her say to him that she had been ""bothered by the patient when on the phone"".\n\nThis was a very disturbing and unpleasant experience.', 'Dr. Kattleman is an EXCELLENT doctor. Very experienced, knowledgeable and always helpful. His receptionist unfortunately is extremely rude, i’ll-mannered and has no patience. I’ve been present to hear the manner in which she speaks to clients (I’ve been seeing him for years) and it is consistent both in person and via telephone. It’s disgusting how impolite and sharp she is, especially since a few of the patients are elderly. I detest having to endure her presence or interact with her at all but it’s a sacrifice to see Dr. Kattleman. I wish there was a negative rating for “staff” because she would warrant it.', 'Dr Kattleman has been my doctor for over 20 years. He’s knowledgeable and helpful.

He really took all the time I needed to explain things to me and do a full examination. However, he answered in a slightly rude manner when confronted with an opinion he didn't share...his bedside manner seems to vary depending on the situation. His knowledge also seemd a bit outdated on certain subjects...I had consulted a few other eye specialists as well as read studies in the litterature claiming the opposite of what he was telling me."", 'Excellent doctor , very supportive , talks to patients ,I see him once a year since 30 years .', 'AN EXCELLENT OPTHAMOLOGIST I HAVE BEEN A PATIENT FROM THE TIME HE BEGAN HIS PRACTICE.

I am glad my optometrist referred me to him.', 'Dr. Kattleman is the most hateful, condescending physician I have ever had the misfortune of seeing. I am stuck consulting him repeatedly because he is an expert in my particular concern, and I dread it every time. He belittles my symptoms and acts as though I am wasting his time, even though I receive a new and clearly needed prescription each visit. On one occasion, he discovered a surgical intervention I had received, and berated me for not telling him (he had never given me any questionnaire, or even asked basic questions to this effect). The surgeon in question had told me never to worry about it again. Dr. Kattleman became even more abrasive than usual, lecturing me and even beginning a sentence with ""Any person of minimal intelligence . . ."" I am ashamed to say I left in tears, because no doctor should ever get away with denigrating a patient in such a way.
