# RateMDs.com-Crawler
This is a crawler to help patients find better doctors on RateMds.com, partially inspired by [this repository](https://github.com/rbanerjee3). See the main notebook for more details. 


## Installation
To run the notebook, you need to have `python`, `jupyter-notebook` and the following python packages installed `selenium`, `pandas`. 

## Usage
Just run the main.ipynb notebook step by step and follow the instructions.

## Examples 
A crawler example (`ophthalmologist_Montreal.csv`) and an analyzer example(`top_ophthalmologist_in_Montreal.csv`) are posted for reference.

## Contributing
Currently, the notebook only works for a few major Canadian cities by default. But it should be easy to add more places as RateMds.com uses the same url template for all locations. All contributions are welcome.
